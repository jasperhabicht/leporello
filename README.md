A simple LaTeX document class to create folding flyers with two key features:

1) Columns are created first and then placed on a page of the folding flyer. This way, columns can be used multiple times on pages with varying widths.
2) Boxes with padding and background (including bleed) can be typeset easily and positioned in a column.
