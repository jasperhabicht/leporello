# The `leporello` class

A simple LaTeX document class to create folded leaflets with the following key features:

- The document layout consists of a specific number of pages that can have varying widths and are placed next to each other. Each page contains one frame to contain typeset material.
- Material is typeset in boxes and boxes are positioned in columns which in turn are placed into the frames on the pages of the document.
- Columns are predefined and then placed into the frame of a page in the document layout. This way, columns can be used on pages with varying widths.
- Boxes can have padding (including bleed) and a background and are positioned inside a column.
